## Apr 2020 - Broadway musical 

As part of my R learning journey, I (try to) practise on tidytuesday projects - this is one of them.

This tidytuesday project deals with Broadway musical data. Here I explore:
* The top 10 shows in terms of cumulative gross earnings (simple use of gghighlight)
* The proportion of Broadway's annual gross earnings that goes to each quintile of shows (split by earnings)
  * Think of this as "inequality" in Broadway earnings across shows


### Files

The relevant files are:
* broadway-clean.R - R script. (Yes I'm aware It's not that clean yet...)
* grosses.csv - input data. The R script pulls data directly from the tidytuesday repository but in case something doesn't work, you can use this as the backup.
* broadway earning shares.png and top10shows_gghighlight.png are outputs from the script
  * broadway earning shares2.png is a smaller size version (set dpi = 100 instead)
