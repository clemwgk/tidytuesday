## Apr 2020 - Broadway musical 

As part of my R learning journey, I (try to) practise on tidytuesday projects - this is one of them.

This tidytuesday project deals with Broadway musical data. Here I explore:
* The top 10 shows in terms of cumulative gross earnings
* The proportion of Broadway's annual gross earnings that goes to each quintile of shows (split by earnings)
  * Think of this as "inequality" in Broadway earnings across shows
